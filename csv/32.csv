That is, the size, space requirements, and runtime of the garbled program are the same as those of the input program, up to poly-logarithmic factors and a polynomial in the security parameter. The scheme can be used to construct indistinguishability obfuscators for RAMprograms with comparable efficiency, at the price of requiring sub-exponential security of the underlying primitives. In particular, this opens the door to obfuscated computations that are sublinear in the length of their inputs. The scheme builds on the recent schemes of Koppula-Lewko-Waters and Canetti-Holmgren-Jain-Vaikuntanathan [STOC 15]. A key technical challenge here is how to combine the fixed-prefix technique of KLW, which was developed for deterministic programs, with randomized Oblivious RAM techniques. To overcome that, we develop a method for arguing about the indistinguishability of two obfuscated randomized programs that use correlated randomness. Along the way, we also define and construct garbling schemes that offer only partial protection. These may be of independent interest.","Delegation; Garbling; Obfuscation; Randomized Encodings","Computational methods; Delegation; Deterministic programs; Encodings; Garbling; Indistinguishability; Obfuscation; Poly-logarithmic factors; Technical challenges; Computer science","","","","","","","Applebaum B., Brakerski Z., Obfuscating circuits via composite-order graded encoding, Theory of Cryptography-12th Theory of Cryptography Conference, TCC, pp. 528-556, (2015); Boyle E., Chung K., Pass R., On Extractability Obfuscation Theory of Cryptography-11th Theory of Cryptography Conference, TCC 2014, pp. 52-73, (2014); Barak B., Goldreich O., Impagliazzo R., Rudich S., Sahai A., Vadhan S.P., Yang K., On the (im)possibility of obfuscating programs, CRYPTO, pp. 1-18, (2001); Barak B., Garg S., Tauman Kalai Y., Paneth O., Sahai A., Protecting obfuscation against algebraic attacks, Phong Q.
