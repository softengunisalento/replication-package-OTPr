We design efficient garbled-circuit-based two-party protocols secure against malicious adversaries. Recent works by Lindell (Crypto 2013) and Huang-Katz-Evans (Crypto 2013) have obtained optimal complexity for cut-and-choose performed over garbled circuits in the single execution setting. We show that it is possible to obtain much lower amortized overhead for cut-and-choose in the multiple-execution setting. Our efficiency improvements result from a novel way to combine a recent technique of Lindell (Crypto 2013) with LEGO-based cut-and-choose techniques (TCC 2009, Eurocrypt 2013). In concrete terms, for 40-bit statistical security we obtain a 2x improvement (per execution) in communication and computation for as few as 7 executions, and require only 8 garbled circuits (i.e., a 5x improvement) per execution for as low as 3500 executions. Our results suggest the exciting possibility that secure two-party computation in the malicious setting can be less than an order of magnitude more expensive than in the semi-honest setting. © 2014 International Association for Cryptologic Research.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Efficiency improvement; Garbled circuits; Malicious adversaries; Optimal complexity; Secure two-party computations; Statistical securities; Two-party protocols; Cryptography","","","","","National Science Foundation, (1111599)","","Applebaum B., Ishai Y., Kushilevitz E., Waters B., Encoding functions with constant online rate or how to compress garbled circuits keys, LNCS, 8043, pp. 166-184, (2013); Beaver D., Precomputing oblivious transfer, LNCS, 963, pp. 97-109, (1995); Bellare M., Hoang V.T., Rogaway P., Adaptively secure garbling with applications to one-time programs and secure outsourcing, LNCS, 7658, pp. 134-153, (2012); Cash D., Jarecki S., Jutla C., Krawczyk H., Rosu M.-C., Steiner M., Highlyscalable searchable symmetric encryption with support for boolean queries, LNCS, 8042, pp. 353-373, (2013); Damgard I., Orlandi C., Multiparty computation for dishonest majority: From passive to active security at low cost, LNCS, 6223, pp. 558-576, (2010); Frederiksen T.K., Jakobsen T.P., Nielsen J.B., Nordholt P.S., Orlandi C., Mini-LEGO: Efficient secure two-party computation from general assumptions, LNCS, 7881, pp. 537-556, (2013); Gennaro R., Gentry C., Parno B., Non-interactive verifiable computing: Outsourcing computation to untrusted workers, LNCS, 6223, pp. 465-482, (2010); Gordon S.D., Katz J., Kolesnikov V., Krell F., Malkin T., Raykova M., Vahlis Y., Secure two-party computation in sublinear (amortized) time, ACM CCS 2012, pp. 513-524, (2012); Huang Y., Katz J., Evans D., Efficient secure two-party computation using symmetric cut-and-choose, LNCS, 8043, pp. 18-35, (2013); Ishai Y., Kilian J., Nissim K., Petrank E., Extending oblivious transfers efficiently, LNCS, 2729, pp. 145-161, (2003); Ishai Y., Prabhakaran M., Sahai A., Founding cryptography on oblivious transfer - Efficiently, LNCS, 5157, pp. 572-591, (2008); Jarecki S., Jutla C.S., Krawczyk H., Rosu M.C., Steiner M., Outsourced symmetric private information retrieval, ACM CCS 2013, pp. 875-888, (2013); Kiraz M., Schoenmakers B., A protocol issue for the malicious case of Yao's garbled-circuit construction, 27th Symposium on Information Theory in the Benelux, pp. 283-290, (2006); Lindell Y., Fast cut-and-choose based protocols for malicious and covert adversaries, LNCS, 8043, pp. 1-17, (2013); Lindell Y., Pinkas B., An efficient protocol for secure two-party computation in the presence of malicious adversaries, LNCS, 4515, pp. 52-78, (2007); Lindell Y., Pinkas B., Secure two-party computation via cut-and-choose oblivious transfer, LNCS, 6597, pp. 329-346, (2011); Lindell Y., Riva B., Cut-and-choose secure computation in the online/offline and batch settings, LNCS, 8617, pp. 476-494, (2014); Malkhi D., Nisan N., Pinkas B., Sella Y., Fairplay - A secure two-party computation system, 13th USENIX Security Symposium, (2004); Mohassel P., Franklin M., Efficiency tradeoffs for malicious two-party computation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3958 LNCS, pp. 458-473, (2006); Mohassel P., Riva B., Garbled circuits checking garbled circuits: More efficient and secure two-party computation, LNCS, 8043, pp. 36-53, (2013); Nielsen J.B., Nordholt P.S., Orlandi C., Burra S.S., A new approach to practical active-secure two-party computation, LNCS, 7417, pp. 681-700, (2012); Nielsen J.B., Orlandi C., LEGO for two-party secure computation, LNCS, 5444, pp. 368-386, (2009); Pappas V., Vo B., Krell F., Choi S.G., Kolesnikov V., Bellovin S., Keromytis A., Malkin T., Blind seer: A scalable private DBMS, 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, (2014); Pinkas B., Fair secure two-party computation, LNCS, 2656, pp. 87-105, (2003); Shelat A., Shen C.-H., Two-Output Secure Computation with Malicious Adversaries, LNCS, 6632, pp. 386-405, (2011); Woodruff D.P., Revisiting the efficiency of malicious two-party computation, LNCS, 4515, pp. 79-96, (2007); Yao A.C.C., How to generate and exchange secrets, 27th FOCS, pp. 162-167, (1986)","","","Springer Verlag","International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)","34rd Annual International Cryptology Conference, CRYPTO 2014","17 August 2014 through 21 August 2014","Santa Barbara, CA","106664","03029743","978-366244380-4","","","English","Lect.
