Particularly, one-timesness cannot be achieved just by deploying cryptographic measures, and one needs to resort to some form of tamper-proofness or the assistance from external cloud servers for “key-disabling”. In this work, we extend the latter such that a delegatee can sign a message without the delegator’s involvement with the assumption that there exists at least one honest cloud server with secure erasure to achieve one-timeness. In this setting, if the delegator just shares their signing key between the delegatee and cloud servers, it may be problematic. It is because in the worst case, the delegator cannot know whether or not a signing key theft occurred because the signatures generated illegally are indistinguishable from the ones generated legally. To solve this, first we propose an efficient one-time delegation scheme of Okamoto-Schnorr signing. Further we combine the basic delegation scheme with anonymous credentials such that the delegator can detect the signing key theft even if one-time delegation is broken while also achieving unlinkability for both the delegator and cloud servers. Further we show its application to an e-cash scheme, which can prevent double-spending. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anonymous credential; Delegation; E-cash; Signature","Crime; Distributed database systems; Network security; Anonymous credential; Cryptographic measures; Distributed systems; E-cash schemes; ITS applications; Resource sharing; Secure erasures; Unlinkability; Cloud computing","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20K11807)","Acknowledgments.
