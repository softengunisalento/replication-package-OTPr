However, there are also increasing concerns regarding the improper use of individual data owner’s private data. In this paper, we propose PrivacyGuard, a system that leverages blockchain smart contract and trusted execution environment (TEE) to enable individual’s control over the access and usage of their private data. Smart contracts are used to specify data usage policy, i.e., who can use what data under which conditions and what analytics to perform, while the distributed blockchain ledger is used to keep an irreversible and non-repudiable data usage record. To address the efficiency problem of on-chain contract execution and to prevent exposing private data on the publicly viewable blockchain, PrivacyGuard incorporates a novel TEE-based off-chain contract execution engine along with a protocol to securely commit the execution result onto blockchain. We have built and deployed a prototype of PrivacyGuard with Ethereum and Intel SGX. Our experiment result demonstrates that PrivacyGuard fulfills the promised privacy goal and supports analytics on data from a considerable number of data owners. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Blockchain; Data access and usage control; Privacy; Smart contract; Trusted execution","Access control; Advanced Analytics; Data Analytics; Security systems; Contract execution; Data usage; Number of datum; Private data; Societal impacts; Trusted execution environments; Blockchain","","","","","US National Science Foundation, (CNS-1916902, CNS-1916926)","Acknowledgment.
