All these works have in common that they assume the tokens to be completely isolated from their creator, but this is a strong assumption. In this work we investigate the feasibility of cryptographic protocols in the setting where the isolation of the hardware token is weakened. We consider two cases: (1) the token can relay messages to its creator, or (2) the creator can send messages to the token after it is sent to the receiver. We provide a detailed characterization for both settings, presenting both impossibilities and information-theoretically secure solutions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Hardware Tokens; Isolation Assumption; Oblivious Transfer; One-Time Memory; UC security","Cryptography; Hardware; Information theory; Hardware tokens; Isolation Assumption; Oblivious transfer; One-time; UC security; Hardware security","","","","","","","Agrawal S., Ananth P., Goyal V., Prabhakaran M., Rosen A., Lower bounds in the hardware token model, TCC 2014.
