But in real life, due to various physical attacks, it is extremely difficult to construct hardware devices that are guaranteed to be leakage-proof. In this paper, we study the feasibility of general two-party computation using leaky hardware tokens. Our main result is a completeness theorem that shows that every non-trivial leaky two-party functionality can be used for general secure computation. In fact, the protocol we construct is non-interactive and unconditionally secure. There are no restrictions on the leakage functions associated with the token, except that it does not render the tokens trivial, by revealing its entire secrets to the adversary. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","","Cryptography; Hardware; Completeness theorems; Hardware devices; Hardware tokens; Non-trivial; Physical attacks; Secure computation; Two-party computation; Unconditionally secure; Automata theory","","","","","","","Agrawal S., Ananth P., Goyal V., Prabhakaran M., Rosen A., Lower bounds in the hardware token model, LNCS, 8349, pp. 663-687, (2014); Agrawal S., Goyal V., Jain A., Prabhakaran M., Sahai A., New impossibility results for concurrent composition and a non-interactive completeness theorem for secure computation, LNCS, 7417, pp. 443-460, (2012); Bitansky N., Canetti R., Goldwasser S., Halevi S., Kalai Y.T., Rothblum G.N., Program obfuscation with leaky hardware, LNCS, 7073, pp. 722-739, (2011); Brands S., Untraceable off-line cash in wallets with observers, LNCS, 773, pp. 302-318, (1994); Brumley D., Boneh D., Remote timing attacks are practical, Computer Networks, 48, 5, pp. 701-716, (2005); Chandran N., Goyal V., Sahai A., New constructions for UC secure computation using tamper-proof hardware, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 4965 LNCS, pp. 545-562, (2008); Chaum D., Pedersen T.P., Wallet databases with observers, LNCS, 740, pp. 89-105, (1993); Choi S.G., Kiayias A., Malkin T., Bitr: Built-in tamper resilience, LNCS, 7073, pp. 740-758, (2011); Cramer R., Pedersen T.P., Improved privacy in wallets with observers, LNCS, 765, pp. 329-343, (1994); Damgard I.B., Nielsen J.B., Wichs D., Isolated proofs of knowledge and isolated zero knowledge, LNCS, 4965, pp. 509-526, (2008); Dottling N., Kraschewski D., Muller-Quade J., Unconditional and composable security using a single stateful tamper-proof hardware token, LNCS, 6597, pp. 164-181, (2011); Dziembowski S., Pietrzak K., Leakage-resilient cryptography, IEEE 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS 2008, pp. 293-302, (2008); Garg S., Jain A., Sahai A., Leakage-resilient zero knowledge, LNCS, 6841, pp. 297-315, (2011); Gennaro R., Lysyanskaya A., Malkin T., Micali S., Rabin T., Algorithmic tamper-proof (atp) security: Theoretical foundations for security against hardware tampering, LNCS, 2951, pp. 258-277, (2004); Gennaro R., Lysyanskaya A., Malkin T., Micali S., Rabin T., Algorithmic tamper-proof (atp) security: Theoretical foundations for security against hardware tampering, LNCS, 2951, pp. 258-277, (2004); Goldreich O., The Foundations of Cryptography.
