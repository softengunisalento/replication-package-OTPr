Bob can have the function evaluated exclusively on a single input of his choosing. Once executed, the program will fail to evaluate on any other input. State-of-the-art one-time programs have remained theoretical, requiring custom hardware that is cost-ineffective/unavailable, or confined to ad-hoc/unrealistic assumptions. To bridge this gap, we explore how the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of modern CPUs can realize the OTP functionality. Specifically, we build two flavours of such a system: in the first, the TEE directly enforces the one-timeness of the program; in the second, the program is represented with a garbled circuit and the TEE ensures Bob’s input can only be wired into the circuit once, equivalent to a smaller cryptographic primitive called one-time memory. These have different performance profiles: the first is best when Alice’s input is small and Bob’s is large, and the second for the converse. © 2019, International Financial Cryptography Association.","","Cryptography; Program processors; Cryptographic primitives; Custom hardwares; Garbled circuits; IS costs; Performance profile; Single input; State of the art; Trusted execution environments; Chromium compounds","","","","","","","Ayday E., Raisaro J.L., Laren M., Jack P., Fellay J., Hubaux J.P., Privacy-preserving computation of disease risk by using genomic, clinical, and environmental data, Proceedings of USENIX Security Workshop on Health Information Technologies (Healthtech 2013).

However, in reality, ESD events are not selective and thus ESD currents can falsely program OTP memory cells. Many integrated circuit (IC) designers focus only on improving OTP memory control architectures to avoid memory being falsely programmed without mentioning the ESD-introduced memory errors. This article investigates a new ESD architecture and novel ESD avoiding circuits, aiming to solve ESD-introduced memory falsely programmed issues. It should be noted that this article focuses on ESD circuit designs to protect OTP memory instead of OTP control architectures. With such new ESD schemes, our prototype circuits have demonstrated that memory cells can indeed be programmed at IC program mode without ESD stresses. © 2006 IEEE.","","Design; Electrostatic discharge; Integrated circuit manufacture; Semiconductor storage; Circuit designs; Control architecture; ESD stress; Memory cell; Memory control architecture; Memory design; Memory error; Prototype circuits; Electrostatic devices","","","","","","","Shukuri S., Yanagisawa K., Ishibashi K., CMOS process compatible ie-flash (inverse gate electrode flash) technology for system-on-a chip, Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, pp. 179-182, (2001); Miyamoto J.-I., Tsujimoto J.-I., Matsukawa N., Morita S., Shinada K., Nozawa H., Iizuka T., An experimental 5-V-only 256-kbit CMOS EE-PROM with a high-performance single-polysilicon cell, IEEE J.

However, with the progressive disappearance of cash, there is a need for the digital equivalent of physical banknotes to guarantee the same level of anonymity of private payments. Few efforts to solve the double-spending problem exist in P2P payments (i.e., in avoiding the possibility of a payer retaining copies of digital coins in absence of a trusted third party (TTP)), and further research efforts are needed to explore options to preserve the privacy of payments, as per the mandates of numerous central bank digital currency (CBDC) exploratory initiatives, such as the digital euro. Moreover, generic programmability requirements and energetic impacts should be considered. In this paper, we present a sustainable offline P2P payment scheme to face the double-spending problem by means of a one-time program (OTP) approach. The approach consists of wiping the business logic out of a client’s app and allowing financial intermediaries to inject a certified payment code into the user’s device, which will execute (asynchronously and offline) at the time of payment. To do so, we wrap each coin in a program at the time of withdrawal. Then the program exploits the trusted execution environment (TEE) of modern smartphones to transfer itself from the payer to the payee via a direct IoT link. To confirm the validity of the approach, we performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations, specifically focusing on the energetic sustainability of the proposed scheme. Results show that our payment scheme is energetically sustainable as the current absorbed for sending one coin is, at most, ~1.8 mAh on an Apple smartphone. We advance the state-of-the-art because the scheme meets the programmability, anonymity, and sustainability requirements (at the same time). © 2023 by the authors.","cash-like; double-spending; mobile; one-time programs; P2P; reflective architecture; security; trusted execution environment","Electronic money; Sustainable development; Cash-like; Double-spending; Mobile; Offline; One-time program; P2P; Programmability; Reflective architecture; Security; Trusted execution environments; Smartphones","","","","","","","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Decentralized Business Review, (2008); Gellman P., Blockchain: The New Art House, ITNOW, 63, pp. 18-19, (2021); Pocher N., Veneris A., Central Bank Digital Currencies, Handbook on Blockchain, pp. 463-501, (2022); Bilotta N., CBDCs for Dummies: Everything You Need to Know about Central Bank Digital Currency (And Why You Shouldn’t Be Afraid of It); Urbinati E., Belsito A., Cani D., Caporrini A., Capotosto M., Folino S., Galano G., Goretti G., Marcelli G., Tiberi P., Et al., A Digital Euro: A Contribution to the Discussion on Technical Design Choices, (2021); ECB Selects External Companies for Joint Prototyping of User Interfaces for a Digital Euro; Report on a Digital Euro; A Digital Euro; Auer R., Cornelli G., Frost J., Rise of the Central Bank Digital Currencies: Drivers Approaches and Technologies, (2020); Bhawana, Kumar S., Permission blockchain network based central bank digital currency, Proceedings of the 2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies (GUCON), pp. 1-6, (2021); Auer R., Bohme R., The Technology of Retail Central Bank Digital Currency; Bechtel A., Otto-Schleicher D., Possible Characteristics of a TIPS-Based Digital Euro; Reiss D.G., Is money going digital?

Known solutions for one-time programs, however, require specialized secure hardware that is not widely available (or, alternatively, access to blockchains and very strong cryptographic tools). In this work we investigate the possibility of realizing one-time programs from a recent and now more commonly available hardware functionality: the counter lockbox. A counter lockbox is a stateful functionality that protects an encryption key under a user-specified password, and enforces a limited number of incorrect guesses. Counter lockboxes have become widely available in consumer devices and cloud platforms. We show that counter lockboxes can be used to realize one-time programs for general functionalities. We develop a number of techniques to reduce the number of counter lockboxes required for our constructions, that may be of independent interest. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Application programs; Locks (fasteners); Block-chain; Cloud platforms; Commodity hardware; Consumer devices; Cryptographic primitives; CryptoGraphics; Encryption key; Hardware functionalities; Cryptography","","","","","Google Security & Privacy Award; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1942789, CNS-1653110, CNS-1801479, CNS-1814919); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-19-1-2294); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-19-1-0200); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (HR00112020021, HR001120C0084); Johns Hopkins University, JHU","Acknowledgements.

Here we investigate the possibility of building OTM's using quantum mechanical devices. It is known that OTM's cannot exist in a fully-quantum world or in a fully-classical world. Instead, we propose a new model based on isolated qubits - qubits that can only be accessed using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). This model combines a quantum resource (single-qubit measurements) with a classical restriction (on communication between qubits), and can be implemented using current technologies, such as nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. In this model, we construct OTM's that are information-theoretically secure against one-pass LOCC adversaries that use 2-outcome measurements. Our construction resembles Wiesner's old idea of quantum conjugate coding, implemented using random error-correcting codes; our proof of security uses entropy chaining to bound the supremum of a suitable empirical process. In addition, we conjecture that our random codes can be replaced by some class of efficiently-decodable codes, to get computationally-efficient OTM's that are secure against computationally-bounded LOCC adversaries. In addition, we construct data-hiding states, which allow an LOCC sender to encode an (n - O(1))-bit messsage into n qubits, such that at most half of the message can be extracted by a one-pass LOCC receiver, but the whole message can be extracted by a general quantum receiver.","Conjugate coding; Cryptography; Data-hiding states; Local operations and classical communication; Oblivious transfer; One-time programs; Quantum computation","Communication; Computer science; Cryptography; Quantum cryptography; Quantum theory; Conjugate coding; Data-hiding; Local operations and classical communications; Oblivious transfer; One-time; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Goldwasser S., Kalai Y.T., Rothblum G.N., One-time programs, CRYPTO, pp. 39-56, (2008); Goyal V., Ishai Y., Sahai A., Venkatesan R., Wadia A., Founding cryptography on tamper-proof hardware tokens, TCC, pp. 308-326, (2010); Bellare M., Hoang V.T., Rogaway P., Adaptively secure garbling with applications to one-time programs and secure outsourcing, ASIACRYPT, pp. 134-153, (2012); Broadbent A., Gutoski G., Stebila D., Quantum One-time Programs; Lo H.-K., Chau H.F., Is quantum bit commitment really possible?, Phys.

Nonetheless, more and more legislative pressure is being produced to enforce the use of such backdoors. In this work we introduce the concept of disposable cryptographic backdoors which can be used only once and become useless after that. These exotic primitives are impossible in the classical digital world without stateful and secure trusted hardware support, but, as we show, are feasible assuming quantum computation and access to classical stateless hardware tokens. Concretely, we construct a disposable (single-use) version of message authentication codes, and use them to derive a black-box construction of stateful hardware tokens in the above setting with quantum computation and classical stateless hardware tokens. This can be viewed as a generic transformation from stateful to stateless tokens and enables, among other things, one-time programs and memories. This is to our knowledge the first provably secure construction of such primitives from stateless tokens. As an application of disposable cryptographic backdoors we use our constructed primitive above to propose a middle-ground solution to the recent legislative push to backdoor cryptography: the conflict between Apple and FBI. We show that it is possible for Apple to create a one-time backdoor which unlocks any single device, and not even Apple can use it to unlock more than one, i.e., the backdoor becomes useless after it is used. We further describe how to use our ideas to derive a version of CCA-secure public key encryption, which is accompanied with a disposable (i.e., single-use, as in the above scenario) backdoor. © 2019 by the authors.

In this work, we propose to view blockchains as an “enabler”, much like indistinguishability obfuscation [5, 23, 46] or one-way functions, for building a variety of cryptographic systems. Our contributions in this work are as follows: 1. A Framework for Proof-of-Stake based Blockchains: We provide an abstract framework for formally analyzing and defining useful security properties for Proof-of-Stake (POS) based blockchain protocols. Interestingly, for some of our applications, POS based protocols are more suitable. We believe our framework and assumptions would be useful in building applications on top of POS based blockchain protocols even in the future.2. Blockchains as an Alternative to Trusted Setup Assumptions in Cryptography: A trusted setup, such as a common reference string (CRS) has been used to realize numerous systems in cryptography. The paragon example of a primitive requiring trusted setup is a non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) system. We show that already existing blockchains systems including Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. can be used as a foundation (instead of a CRS) to realize NIZK systems. The novel aspect of our work is that it allows for utilizing an already existing (and widely trusted) setup rather than proposing a new one. Our construction does not require any additional functionality from the miners over the already existing ones, nor do we need to modify the underlying blockchain protocol. If an adversary can violate the security of our NIZK, it could potentially also take over billions of dollars worth of coins in the Bitcoin, Ethereum or any such cryptocurrency!We believe that such a “trusted setup” represents significant progress over using CRS published by a central trusted party. Indeed, NIZKs could further serve as a foundation for a variety of other cryptographic applications such as round efficient secure computation [33, 36].3. One-time programs and pay-per use programs: Goldwasser et al. [29] introduced the notion of one time program and presented a construction using tamper-proof hardware. As noted by Goldwasser et al. [29], clearly a one-time program cannot be solely software based, as software can always be copied and run again. While there have been a number of follow up works [4, 6, 30], there are indeed no known constructions of one-time programs which do not rely on self destructing tamper-proof hardware (even if one uses trusted setup or random oracles). Somewhat surprisingly, we show that it is possible to base one-time programs on POS based blockchain systems without relying on trusted hardware. Our ideas do not seem to translate over to Proof-of-Work (POW) based blockchains.We also introduce the notion of pay-per-use programs which is simply a contract between two parties — service provider and customer. A service provider supplies a program such that if the customer transfers a specific amount of coins to the provider, it can evaluate the program on any input of its choice once, even if the provider is offline. This is naturally useful in a subscription based model where your payment is based on your usage. © 2017, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","","Computation theory; Electronic money; Gold; Hardware; Network protocols; Common reference string; Cryptographic applications; Cryptographic systems; Impossibility results; Indistinguishability; Non-interactive zero knowledge; Secure computation; Security properties; Cryptography","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1228599, CNS-1414082); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA","Acknowledgements.

However, despite very advanced functionalities and specific use cases, existing solutions share the natural limitation that the number of usages of these signing rights cannot be efficiently limited, but users can at most be disincentivized to abuse their rights. In this paper, we suggest a solution to this problem based on blockchains. We let a user define a smart contract defining delegated signing rights, which needs to be triggered to successfully sign a message. By leveraging the immutability of the blockchain, our construction can now guarantee that a user-defined threshold of signature invocations cannot be exceeded, thereby circumventing the need for dedicated hardware or similar assistance in existing constructions for one-time programs. We discuss different constructions supporting different features, and provide concrete implementations in the Solidity language of the Ethereum blockchain, proving the real-world efficiency and feasibility of our construction. © 2021 ACM.","Delegatable signatures; one-time programs; smart contracts","Blockchain; Dedicated hardware; One-time; Problem-based; Real-world; Single use; Network security","","","","","SESAR; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (830929, 890456); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG","The projects leading to this work have received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 830929 (“CyberSec4Europe”), from the SESAR Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 890456 (“Slot-Machine”), and from the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (“FlexProd”).","Baldimtsi F., Chase M., Fuchsbauer G., Kohlweiss M., Anonymous Transferable E-Cash, pp. 101-124, (2015); Till Beck M., Camenisch J., Derler D., Krenn S., Pohls H.C., Samelin K., Slamanig D., Practical Strongly Invisible and Strongly Accountable Sanitizable Signatures, pp. 437-452, (2017); Bellare M., Fuchsbauer G., Policy-Based Signatures, pp. 520-537, (2014); Bellare M., Poettering B., Stebila D., Deterring Certificate Subversion: Efficient Double-Authentication-Preventing Signatures, pp. 121-151, (2017); Bernhard D., Pereira O., Warinschi B., How Not to Prove Yourself: Pitfalls of the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic and Applications to Helios, pp. 626-643, (2012); Bilzhause A., Pohls H.C., Samelin K., Position paper: The past, present, and future of sanitizable and redactable signatures, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, pp. 871-879, (2017); Bobolz J., Eidens F., Krenn S., Slamanig D., Striecks C., Privacy-Preserving Incentive Systems with Highly Efficient Point-Collection, pp. 319-333, (2020); Boldyreva A., Palacio A., Warinschi B., Secure Proxy Signature Schemes for Delegation of Signing Rights, 25, 1, pp. 57-115, (2012); Boyle E., Goldwasser S., Ivan I., Functional Signatures and Pseudorandom Functions, pp. 501-519, (2014); Broadbent A., Gutoski G., Stebila D., Quantum One-Time Programs-(Extended Abstract), pp. 344-360, (2013); Camenisch J., Derler D., Krenn S., Pohls H.C., Samelin K., Slamanig D., Chameleon-Hashes with Ephemeral Trapdoors-And Applications to Invisible Sanitizable Signatures, pp. 152-182, (2017); Camenisch J., Stadler M., Efficient Group Signature Schemes for Large Groups (Extended Abstract), pp. 410-424, (1997); Catalano D., Fuchsbauer G., Soleimanian A., Double-Authentication-Preventing Signatures in the Standard Model, pp. 338-358, (2020); Chase M., Kohlweiss M., Lysyanskaya A., Meiklejohn S., Malleable Signatures: New Definitions and Delegatable Anonymous Credentials, pp. 199-213, (2014); Chaum D., Blind Signature System, (1983); Cramer R., Modular Design of Secure Yet Practical Cryptographic Protocols, (1997); Durnoga K., Dziembowski S., Kazana T., Zajac M., One-time programs with limited memory, Information Security and Cryptology-9th International Conference, Inscrypt 2013, pp. 377-394, (2013); Elgamal T., A Public Key Cryptosystem and A Signature Scheme Based on Discrete Logarithms, 31, pp. 469-472, (1985); Fiat A., Shamir A., How to Prove Yourself: Practical Solutions to Identification and Signature Problems, pp. 186-194, (1987); Goldwasser S., Tauman Kalai Y., Rothblum G.N., One-Time Programs, pp. 39-56, (2008); Goldwasser S., Micali S., Rivest R.L., A Digital Signature Scheme Secure against Adaptive Chosen-message Attacks, 17, 2, pp. 281-308, (1988); Goyal R., Goyal V., Overcoming Cryptographic Impossibility Results Using Blockchains, pp. 529-561, (2017); Goyal V., Ishai Y., Sahai A., Venkatesan R., Wadia A., Founding Cryptography on Tamper-Proof Hardware Tokens, pp. 308-326, (2010); Krenn S., Pohls H.C., Samelin K., Slamanig D., Protean Signature Schemes, pp. 256-276, (2018); Poettering B., Stebila D., Double-Authentication-Preventing Signatures, pp. 436-453, (2014); Reitwiessner C., ZkSNARKs Test Code, (2017); Roehsner M., Kettlewell J.A., Batalhao T.B., Fitzsimons J.F., Walther P., Quantum advantage for probabilistic onetime programs, Nature Communications, (2018); Schnorr C., Efficient Identification and Signatures for Smart Cards, pp. 239-252, (1990); Steinfeld R., Bull L., Zheng Y., Content Extraction Signatures, pp. 285-304, (2002); Tan K., Heiswap Dapp, (2019); Wang Y., Pang H., Deng R.H., Verifiably encrypted cascade-instantiable blank signatures to secure progressive decision management, Int.

Can one construct OTM's whose security follows from some physical principle? This is not possible in a fully-classical world, or in a fully-quantum world, but there is evidence that OTM's can be built using ""isolated qubits"" - qubits that cannot be entangled, but can be accessed using adaptive sequences of single-qubit measurements. Here we present new constructions for OTM's using isolated qubits, which improve on previous work in several respects: they achieve a stronger ""single-shot"" security guarantee, which is stated in terms of the (smoothed) min-entropy; they are proven secure against adversaries who can perform arbitrary local operations and classical communication (LOCC); and they are efficiently implementable.

Recent research has shown that such schemes exist even for quantum computation. Given the numerous applications of classical FHE (zero-knowledge proofs, secure two-party computation, obfuscation, etc.) it is reasonable to hope that quantum FHE (or QFHE) will lead to many new results in the quantum setting. However, a crucial ingredient in almost all applications of FHE is circuit verification. Classically, verification is performed by checking a transcript of the homomorphic computation. Quantumly, this strategy is impossible due to no-cloning. This leads to an important open question: can quantum computations be delegated and verified in a non-interactive manner? In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, by constructing a scheme for QFHE with verification (vQFHE). Our scheme provides authenticated encryption, and enables arbitrary polynomial-time quantum computations without the need of interaction between client and server. Verification is almost entirely classical; for computations that start and end with classical states, it is completely classical. As a first application, we show how to construct quantum one-time programs from classical one-time programs and vQFHE. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017.","","Application programs; Authentication; Computation theory; Polynomial approximation; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Security of data; Arbitrary polynomial; Authenticated encryption; Circuit verification; Fully homomorphic encryption; Quantum setting; Recent researches; Secure two-party computations; Zero knowledge proof; Cryptography","","","","","Qubiz - Quantum Innovation Center; Sundhed og Sygdom, Det Frie Forskningsråd, FSS, DFF; Natur og Univers, Det Frie Forskningsråd, FNU, DFF; Villum Fonden, (10059); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (337603); Engineering Research Centers, ERC; European Research Council, ERC; Københavns Universitet, KU; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","Funding text 1: This work was completed while GA was a member of the QMATH center at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen.

The OTP uses a Garbled Circuit (GC), a circuit which does not leak the information except the execution result, as a building block. However, we need to use a special hardware called One-time Memory (OTM) to permit access to only one of two labels necessary for the execution of the GC. When the OTM does not exist or it is expensive, the realistic realization of the OTP is difficult. Furthermore, the OTM needs to be transported to a program executor and needs the production cost. Instead of using OTMs, we propose a way to distribute inputs to multiple cloud storages by using Shamir's secret sharing. In addition, we apply the proposed method to electronic money. Existing electronic money schemes do not prevent double-spending itself, but detect it and identify the double-spender. Therefore, one can double-spend the same electronic money illegally in a short time. Then we can detect the double-spending and identify the double-spender after delivering a product, but the double-spender can abscond with it. To tackle such a problem, we construct an electronic money scheme which prevents double-spending itself based on the OTP that generates a digital signature during a transaction. Combining the proposed electronic money scheme with an existing electronic money scheme, we can also construct another electronic money scheme which can detect double-spending even if the security of the OTP is broken. © 2017 ACM.","Cloud storage; Double-spending; Electronic money; One-time Programs; Secret sharing","Application programs; Cryptography; Public key cryptography; Time sharing programs; Building blockes; Cloud storages; Double-spending; Garbled circuits; ITS applications; One-time; Secret sharing; Special hardware; Electronic money","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (17K00178)","","Bellare M., Rogaway P., The exact security of digital signatures-how to sign with rsa and rabin, International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques, pp. 399-416, (1996); Chaum D., Fiat A., Naor M., Untraceable electronic cash, Proceedings on Advances in Cryptology, pp. 319-327, (1990); Even S., Goldreich O., Lempel A., A randomized protocol for signing contracts, Communications of the ACM, 28, 6, pp. 637-647, (1985); Goldwasser S., Kalai Y.T., Rothblum G.N., One-time programs, Annual International Cryptology Conference, pp. 39-56, (2008); Rabin M.O., How to exchange secrets with oblivious transfer, IACR Cryptology EPrint Archive, (2005); Shamir A., How to share a secret, Communications of the ACM, 22, 11, pp. 612-613, (1979); Snyder P., Yao, Sgarbled Circuits: Recent Directions and Implementations, (2014); Yao A.C.-C., How to generate and exchange secrets, Foundations of Computer Science, 1986, pp. 162-167, (1986)","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGSAC","4th ACM International Workshop on ASIA Public-Key Cryptography, APKC 2017","2 April 2017","Abu Dhabi","127191","","978-145034973-4","","","English","APKC - Proc.

For context: Ekiden (EuroS &P’19) and FastKitten (Sec’19) use enclave-ledger interactions to enable privacy-preserving smart contracts. However, they store the contract’s inputs on-chain, and therefore, are impractical for applications that process large volumes of data or serve large number of users. In contrast, LucidiTEE implements privacy-preserving computation while storing inputs, outputs, and state off-chain, using the ledger only to enforce policies on computation.Chaudhuri et al. (CCS’17) showed that enclave-ledger interactions enable fair secure multiparty computation. In a setting with n processors each of which possesses a TEE, they show how to realize fair secure computation tolerating up to t corrupt parties for any t&lt; n. We improve upon their result by showing a novel protocol which requires only t out of the n processors to possess a TEE.Kaptchuk et al. (NDSS’19) showed that enclave-ledger interactions can enable applications such as one-time programs and rate limited logging. We generalize their ideas to enforcing arbitrary history-based policies within and across several multi-step computations, and formally specify a new functionality for policy-compliant multiparty computation. Summarizing, LucidiTEE enables multiple parties to jointly compute on private data, while enforcing history-based policies even when input providers are offline, and fairness to all output recipients, in a malicious setting. LucidiTEE uses the ledger only to enforce policies; i.e., it does not store inputs, outputs, or state on the ledger, letting it scale to big data computation. We show novel applications including a personal finance app, collaborative machine learning, and policy-based surveys amongst an apriori-unknown set of participants. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.","blockchain; policy compliance; TEE","Application programs; Distributed ledger; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Input state; Input-output; Multiparty computation; Policy compliance; Policy-based; Power; Privacy preserving; TEE; Unified framework; Blockchain","","","","","","","Tendermint Core in Go; Androulaki E., Et al., Hyperledger fabric: A distributed operating system for per-missioned blockchains, Proceedings of the Thirteenth Eurosys Conference, Eurosys 2018, Pp. 30:1–30:15.

In particular, Goldreich and Ostrovsky considered the problem of software protection via oblivious RAM. Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum introduced the concept of one-time programs: in a one-time program, an honest sender sends a set of simple hardware tokens to a (potentially malicious) receiver. The hardware tokens allow the receiver to execute a secret program specified by the sender's tokens exactly once (or, more generally, up to a fixed t times). A recent line of work initiated by Katz examined the problem of achieving UC-secure computation using hardware tokens. Motivated by the goal of unifying and strengthening these previous notions, we consider the general question of basing secure computation on hardware tokens. We show that the following tasks, which cannot be realized in the ""plain"" model, become feasible if the parties are allowed to generate and exchange tamper-proof hardware tokens. - Unconditional and non-interactive secure computation. We show that by exchanging simple stateful hardware tokens, any functionality can be realized with unconditional security against malicious parties. In the case of two-party functionalities f(x,y) which take their inputs from a sender and a receiver and deliver their output to the receiver, our protocol is non-interactive and only requires a unidirectional communication of simple stateful tokens from the sender to the receiver. This strengthens previous feasibility results for one-time programs both by providing unconditional security and by offering general protection against malicious senders. As is typically the case for unconditionally secure protocols, our protocol is in fact UC-secure. This improves over previous works on UC-secure computation based on hardware tokens, which provided computational security under cryptographic assumptions. - Interactive secure computation from stateless tokens based on one-way functions. We show that stateless hardware tokens are sufficient to base general secure (in fact, UC-secure) computation on the existence of one-way functions. - Obfuscation from stateless tokens. We consider the problem of realizing non-interactive secure computation from stateless tokens for functionalities which allow the receiver to provide an arbitrary number of inputs (these are the only functionalities one can hope to realize non-interactively with stateless tokens). By building on recent techniques for resettably secure computation, we obtain a general positive result under standard cryptographic assumptions. This gives the first general feasibility result for program obfuscation using stateless tokens, while strengthening the standard notion of obfuscation by providing security against a malicious sender. © 2010 Springer.","","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Computation theory; Cryptography; Hardware; Network security; Strengthening (metal); Ultrasonics; Arbitrary number; Computational security; Cryptographic assumptions; Non-interactive; One-way functions; Program obfuscation; Secure computation; Secure protocols; Software protection; Tamperproof; Unconditional security; Network protocols","","","","","","","Goldreich O., Ostrovsky R., Software protection and simulation on oblivious rams, J.

Encryption is one of the major techniques that could be used to achieve this gaol. However, data encryption at the rest along is insufficient for secure cloud computation environments. Further efficient techniques for carrying out computation over encrypted data are also required. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and garbled circuits are naturally used to process encrypted data without leaking any information about the data. However, existing FHE schemes are inefficient for processing large amount of data in cloud and garbled circuits are one time programs and cannot be reused. Using modern technologies such as FHE, several authors have developed reusable garbled circuit techniques in recent years. But they are not efficient either and could not be deployed at a large scale. By relaxing the privacy definition from perfect forward secrecy to all-or-nothing privacy, we are able to design efficient reusable garbled circuits in this paper. These reusable garbled computation techniques could be used for processing encrypted cloud data efficiently. © 2016","Cloud computing; Garbled circuits; Reusable garbled computation","Cloud computing; Data handling; Data privacy; Appropriate techniques; Computation environments; Computation techniques; Data encryption; Fully homomorphic encryption; Garbled circuits; Modern technologies; Perfect forward secrecy; Cryptography","","","","","Qatar Foundation, QF, (NPRP X-063-1-014, NPRP8-2158-1-423)","Work was done when the first author was at Qatar University.

Even if the tamper-proof hardware is issued by one of the parties, and hence not necessarily trusted by the other, many tasks become possible: Tamper proof hardware is sufficient for universally composable protocols, for information-theoretically secure protocols, and even allow to create software which can only be used once (One-Time-Programs). However, all known protocols employing tamper-proof hardware are either indirect, i.e., additional computational assumptions must be used to obtain general two party computations or a large number of devices must be used. In this work we present the first protocol realizing universally composable two-party computations (and even trusted One-Time-Programs) with information-theoretic security using only one single tamper-proof device issued by one of the mutually distrusting parties. © 2011 International Association for Cryptologic Research.","Information-Theoretical Security; Secure Two-Party Computation; Tamper-Proof Hardware; Universal Composability","Computation theory; Cryptography; Information theory; Computational assumptions; Cryptographic assumptions; Information- theoretic securities; Information-Theoretical Security; Secure two-party computations; Tamper proof; Universal composability; Universally composable; Hardware security","","","","","","","Beaver D., Correlated pseudorandomness and the complexity of private computations, STOC, pp. 479-488, (1996); Ben-Or M., Goldwasser S., Kilian J., Wigderson A., Multi-prover interactive proofs: How to remove intractability assumptions, STOC, pp. 113-131, (1988); Brouchier J., Kean T., Marsh C., Naccache D., Temperature attacks, IEEE Security & Privacy, 7, 2, pp. 79-82, (2009); Canetti R., Universally composable security: A new paradigm for cryptographic protocols, FOCS, pp. 136-145, (2001); Canetti R., Dodis Y., Pass R., Walfish S., Universally composable security with global setup, LNCS, 4392, pp. 61-85, (2007); Canetti R., Fischlin M., Universally Composable Commitments, LNCS, 2139, pp. 19-40, (2001); Damgard I., Nielsen J.B., Wichs D., Isolated proofs of knowledge and isolated zero knowledge, LNCS, 4965, pp. 509-526, (2008); Damgard I., Nielsen J.B., Wichs D., Universally Composable Multiparty Computation with Partially Isolated Parties, (2007); Even S., Goldreich O., Lempel A., A randomized protocol for signing contracts, Commun.

However, almost all quantum cryptography faces extreme difficulties with the near-term intermediate-scale quantum technology (NISQ technology); namely, the short lifespan of quantum states and limited sequential computation. At the same time, considering only limited quantum adversaries may still enable us to achieve never-before-possible tasks. In this work, we consider quantum cryptographic primitives against limited quantum adversaries - depth-bounded adversaries. We introduce a model for (depth-bounded) NISQ computers, which are classical circuits interleaved with shallow quantum circuits. Then, we show one-time memory can be achieved against any depth-bounded quantum adversaries introduced in the work, with their depth being any pre-fixed polynomial. Therefore we obtain applications like one-time programs and one-time proofs. Finally, we show our one-time memory has correctness even against constant-rate errors. © Qipeng Liu; licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0.","cryptographic protocol; one-time memory; quantum cryptography","Application programs; Quantum optics; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic protocols; Lifespans; Of quantum-information; One-time memory; Power; Quantum limited; Quantum state; Quantum technologies; Sequential computations; Quantum cryptography","","","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (HR00112020023); Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, University of California Berkeley","Funding Qipeng Liu: supported in part by the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, through a Quantum Postdoctoral Fellowship and by the DARPA sieve-vespa grant HR00112020023.","Aaronson Scott, Quantum copy-protection and quantum money, 2009 24th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity, pp. 229-242, (2009); Aaronson Scott, Christiano Paul, Quantum money from hidden subspaces, Proceedings of the forty-fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, pp. 41-60, (2012); Aaronson Scott, Liu Jiahui, Liu Qipeng, Zhandry Mark, Zhang Ruizhe, New approaches for quantum copy-protection, Annual International Cryptology Conference, pp. 526-555, (2021); Ambainis Andris, Nayak Ashwin, Ta-Shma Amnon, Vazirani Umesh, Dense quantum coding and quantum finite automata, Journal of the ACM (JACM), 49, 4, pp. 496-511, (2002); Arute Frank, Arya Kunal, Babbush Ryan, Bacon Dave, Bardin Joseph C, Barends Rami, Biswas Rupak, Boixo Sergio, Brandao Fernando GSL, Buell David A, Et al., Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor, Nature, 574, 7779, pp. 505-510, (2019); Barak Boaz, Goldreich Oded, Impagliazzo Rusell, Rudich Steven, Sahai Amit, Vadhan Salil, Yang Ke, On the (im) possibility of obfuscating programs, Annual international cryptology conference, pp. 1-18, (2001); Bartusek James, Khurana Dakshita, Cryptography with certified deletion, (2022); Behera Amit, Sattath Or, Shinar Uriel, Noise-tolerant quantum tokens for mac, (2021); Bellare Mihir, Rogaway Phillip, Random oracles are practical: A paradigm for designing efficient protocols, Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 62-73, (1993); Bennett Charles H, Bernstein Ethan, Brassard Gilles, Vazirani Umesh, Strengths and weaknesses of quantum computing, SIAM journal on Computing, 26, 5, pp. 1510-1523, (1997); Bennett Charles H, Brassard Gilles, Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing, (2020); Bitansky Nir, Goldwasser Shafi, Jain Abhishek, Paneth Omer, Vaikuntanathan Vinod, Waters Brent, Time-lock puzzles from randomized encodings, Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science, pp. 345-356, (2016); Blocki Jeremiah, Lee Seunghoon, Zhou Samson, On the security of proofs of sequential work in a post-quantum world, (2020); Boneh Dan, Dagdelen Ozgur, Fischlin Marc, Lehmann Anja, Schaffner Christian, Zhandry Mark, Random oracles in a quantum world, Advances in Cryptology - ASIACRYPT 2011-17th International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security, Seoul, South Korea, December 4-8, 2011.

However, traditional secret sharing schemes are often insufficient, especially for applications in which the set of parties who hold the secret shares might change over time. To achieve security in this setting, dynamic proactive secret sharing (DPSS) is used. DPSS schemes proactively update the secret shares held by the parties and allow changes to the set of parties holding the secrets. We propose FaB-DPSS (FAst Batched DPSS) – a new and highly optimized batched DPSS scheme. While previous work on batched DPSS [BDLO15] focuses on a single client submitting a batch of secrets and does not allow storing and releasing secrets independently, we allow multiple different clients to dynamically share and release secrets. FaB-DPSS is the most efficient robust DPSS scheme that supports the highest possible adversarial threshold of 12. We prove FaB-DPSS secure and implement it. All operations complete in seconds, and we outperform a prior state-of-the-art DPSS scheme [MZW+19] by over 6 ×. Additionally, we propose new applications of DPSS in the context of blockchains. Specifically, we propose a protocol that uses blockchains and FaB-DPSS to provide conditional secret storage. The protocol allows parties to store secrets along with a release condition, and once a (possibly different) party satisfies this release condition, the secret is privately released to that party. This functionality is similar to extractable witness encryption. While there are numerous compelling applications (e.g., time-lock encryption, one-time programs, and fair multi-party computation) which rely on extractable witness encryption, there are no known efficient constructions (or even constructions based on any well-studied assumptions) of extractable witness encryption. However, by utilizing blockchains and FaB-DPSS, we can easily build all those applications. We provide an implementation of our conditional secret storage protocol as well as several applications building on top of it. © 2022, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","","Application programs; Computation theory; Cryptography; Block-chain; Change-over time; Condition; Extractables; In-control; Learn+; Proactive secret sharing; Proactive Secret Sharing Schemes; Secret sharing schemes; State of the art; Blockchain","","","","","CONIX Research Center; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1801369); Semiconductor Research Corporation, SRC; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (1916939); Alfred P.

To demonstrate the cryptographic potential of this technology, we first develop a formalism that captures (in a minimalistic way) the functionality and security properties provided by the technology. Next, using this technology, we construct and prove security of two cryptographic applications that are currently obtainable only via trusted hardware that implements logical circuitry (either classical or quantum). The first application is a password-controlled secure vault where the stored data is irrecoverably erased once a threshold of unsuccessful access attempts is reached. The second is (a somewhat relaxed version of) one time programs, namely a device that allows evaluating a secret function only a limited number of times before self-destructing, where each evaluation is made on a fresh user-chosen input. Finally, while our constructions, modeling, and analysis are designed to capture the proposed polymer-based technology, they are sufficiently general to be of potential independent interest. © 2022, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","","Digital storage; Consumables; Cryptographic applications; CryptoGraphics; One-time; Property; Protein polymers; Security properties; Self destruct; Sequencing problems; Trusted hardwares; Cryptography","","","","","Columbia-IBM center for Blockchain; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (00112020023, 001120C00, 17AP00027)","Acknowledgements.

One-time programs cannot be achieved by software alone, as any software can be copied and re-run. However, it is known that every circuit can be compiled into a one-time program using a very basic hypothetical hardware device called a one-time memory. At first glance it may seem that quantum information, which cannot be copied, might also allow for one-time programs. But it is not hard to see that this intuition is false: one-time programs for classical or quantum circuits based solely on quantum information do not exist, even with computational assumptions. This observation raises the question, ""what assumptions are required to achieve one-time programs for quantum circuits?"" Our main result is that any quantum circuit can be compiled into a one-time program assuming only the same basic one-time memory devices used for classical circuits. Moreover, these quantum one-time programs achieve statistical universal composability (UC-security) against any malicious user. Our construction employs methods for computation on authenticated quantum data, and we present a new quantum authentication scheme called the trap scheme for this purpose. As a corollary, we establish UC-security of a recent protocol for delegated quantum computation. © 2013 International Association for Cryptologic Research.","","Cryptography; Logic circuits; Quantum computers; Computational assumptions; Extended abstracts; Hardware devices; Quantum authentication; Quantum circuit; Quantum data; Quantum Information; Universal composability; Quantum optics","","","","","","","Goldwasser S., Kalai Y., Rothblum G., One-time programs, LNCS, 5157, pp. 39-56, (2008); Bellare M., Hoang V.T., Rogaway P., Adaptively secure garbling with applications to one-time programs and secure outsourcing, LNCS, 7658, pp. 134-153, (2012); Goyal V., Ishai Y., Sahai A., Venkatesan R., Wadia A., Founding cryptography on tamper-proof hardware tokens, LNCS, 5978, pp. 308-326, (2010); Aaronson S., Quantum copy-protection and quantum money, Proc. 24th IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity, CCC 2009, pp. 229-242, (2009); Mosca M., Stebila D., Quantum coins, Contemporary Mathematics, 523, pp. 35-47, (2010); Barak B., Goldreich O., Impagliazzo R., Rudich S., Sahai A., Vadhan S., Yang K., On the (im)possibility of obfuscating programs, LNCS, 2139, pp. 1-18, (2001); Aharonov D., Ben-Or M., Eban E., Interactive proofs for quantum computations, Proc.

But some applications - notably one-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum 2008) and secure outsourcing (Gennaro, Gentry, Parno 2010) - need adaptive security, where x may depend on F. We identify gaps in proofs from these papers with regard to adaptive security and suggest the need of a better abstraction boundary. To this end we investigate the adaptive security of garbling schemes, an abstraction of Yao's garbled-circuit technique that we recently introduced (Bellare, Hoang, Rogaway 2012). Building on that framework, we give definitions encompassing privacy, authenticity, and obliviousness, with either coarse-grained or fine-grained adaptivity. We show how adaptively secure garbling schemes support simple solutions for one-time programs and secure outsourcing, with privacy being the goal in the first case and obliviousness and authenticity the goal in the second.We give transforms that promote static-secure garbling schemes to adaptive-secure ones. Our work advances the thesis that conceptualizing garbling schemes as a first-class cryptographic primitive can simplify, unify, or improve treatments for higher-level protocols. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2012.","","Abstracting; Outsourcing; Security of data; Adaptive security; Adaptivity; Coarse-grained; Cryptographic primitives; Garbled circuits; Higher-level protocols; Standard constructions; Static security; Cryptography","","","","","","","Applebaum B., Ishai Y., Kushilevitz E., From Secrecy to Soundness: Efficient Verification via Secure Computation, LNCS, 6198, pp. 152-163, (2010); Bellare M., Dowsley R., Waters B., Yilek S., Standard Security Does Not Imply Security against Selective-Opening, LNCS, 7237, 2012, pp. 645-662; Bellare M., Hoang V., Rogaway P., Adaptively secure garbling with applications to one-time programs and secure outsourcing, Cryptology ePrint Archive, 2012; Bellare M., Hoang V., Rogaway P., Foundations of garbled circuits, ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2012), (2012); Canetti R., Feige U., Goldreich O., Naor M., Adaptively secure multi-party computation, 28th ACM STOC, pp. 639-648, (1996); Choi S.G., Dachman-Soled D., Malkin T., Wee H., Improved Non-committing Encryption with Applications to Adaptively Secure Protocols, LNCS, 5912, pp. 287-302, (2009); Chung K.-M., Kalai Y., Vadhan S., Improved Delegation of Computation Using Fully Homomorphic Encryption, LNCS, 6223, pp. 483-501, (2010); Damgard I., Nielsen J.B., Improved Non-committing Encryption Schemes Based on a General Complexity Assumption, LNCS, 1880, pp. 432-450, (2000); Gennaro R., Gentry C., Parno B., Non-interactive Verifiable Computing: Outsourcing Computation to Untrusted Workers, LNCS, 6223, pp. 465-482, (2010); Goldreich O., Foundations of Cryptography: Basic Applications, 2, (2004); Goldreich O., Micali S., Wigderson A., How to play any mental game or a completeness theorem for protocols with honest majority, STOC, pp. 218-229, (1987); Goldwasser S., Kalai Y.T., Rothblum G.N., One-time Programs, (2012); Goldwasser S., Kalai Y.T., Rothblum G.N., One-Time Programs, LNCS, 5157, pp. 39-56, (2008); Goyal V., Ishai Y., Sahai A., Venkatesan R., Wadia A., Founding Cryptography on Tamper-Proof Hardware Tokens, LNCS, 5978, pp. 308-326, (2010); Ishai Y., Kushilevitz E., Randomizing polynomials: A new representation with applications to round-efficient secure computation, 41st FOCS, pp. 294-304, (2000); Kamara S., Wei L., Special-purpose Garbled Circuits, (2012); Lindell Y., Pinkas B., A proof of security of Yao's protocol for two-party computation, Journal of Cryptology, 22, 2, pp. 161-188, (2009); Naor M., Pinkas B., Sumner R., Privacy preserving auctions and mechanism design, Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, pp. 129-139, (1999); Nielsen J.B., Separating Random Oracle Proofs from Complexity Theoretic Proofs: The Non-committing Encryption Case, LNCS, 2442, pp. 111-126, (2002); Yao A., Protocols for secure computations, FOCS, pp. 160-164, (1982); Yao A., How to generate and exchange secrets, 27th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 162-167, (1986)","","","Springer Verlag","Huawei Technologies Co.

Probabilistic one-time programs harness these capabilities for quantum-assisted classical computations by encoding classical software in small quantum states resulting in computer programs that can be used only once. Such self-destructing one-time programs facilitate a variety of applications reaching from software distribution to one-time delegation of signature authority. Whereas previous experiments demonstrated the feasibility of such schemes, the practical applications were limited. Here we present an improved protocol for one-time programs that resolves major drawbacks of previous schemes, by employing entangled qubit pairs.

Today's practical defenses are typically attack-specific countermeasures against certain classes of side-channel attacks. The demand for a more general solution has given rise to the recent theoretical research that aims to build provably leakage-resilient cryptography. This direction is, however, very new and still largely lacks practitioners' evaluation with regard to both efficiency and practical security. A recent approach, One-Time Programs (OTPs), proposes using Yao's Garbled Circuit (GC) and very simple tamper-proof hardware to securely implement oblivious transfer, to guarantee leakage resilience. Our main contributions are (i) a generic architecture for using GC/ OTP modularly, and (ii) hardware implementation and efficiency analysis of GC/OTP evaluation. We implemented two FPGA-based prototypes: a system-on-a-programmable-chip with access to hardware crypto accelerator (suitable for smartcards and future smartphones), and a stand-alone hardware implementation (suitable for ASIC design). We chose AES as a representative complex function for implementation and measurements. As a result of this work, we are able to understand, evaluate and improve the practicality of employing GC/OTP as a leakage-resistance approach. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Efficiency; Embedded systems; Hardware security; Network security; Smart cards; Timing circuits; Crypto-accelerators; Cryptographic implementation; Efficiency analysis; Generic architecture; Hardware implementations; Leakage-resilient cryptographies; System on a programmable chips; Theoretical research; Side channel attack","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (216499)","","Akkar M.-L., Giraud C., An implementation of des and AES, secure against some attacks, CHES 2001.

However, ideal one-time programs have been proved to be unachievable using either classical or quantum resources. Here we relax the definition of one-time programs to allow some probability of error in the output and show that quantum mechanics offers security advantages over purely classical resources. We introduce a scheme for encoding probabilistic one-time programs as quantum states with prescribed measurement settings, explore their security, and experimentally demonstrate various one-time programs using measurements on single-photon states. These include classical logic gates, a program to solve Yao’s millionaires problem, and a one-time delegation of a digital signature. By combining quantum and classical technology, we demonstrate that quantum techniques can enhance computing capabilities even before full-scale quantum computers are available. © 2018, The Author(s).","","detection method; probability; quantum mechanics; software; technological change; Article; computer security; entropy; mathematical analysis; one time program; photon; probability; quantum mechanics; randomization; software","","","","","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA2386-15-1-4082); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (608062, 641039, 820474); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF, (NRF-NRFF2013-01); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (PDSE 99999.005394/2014-07); Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (FA2386-17-1-4011, FA9550-16-1-0004, Y585-N20); Universität Wien; Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG","We thank I.
