Unfortunately, these OTM constructions leak some information, and standard methods for privacy amplification cannot be applied here, because the adversary has advance knowledge of the hash function that the honest parties will use. In this paper we show a stronger form of privacy amplification that solves this problem, using a fixed hash function that is secure against all possible adversaries in the isolated qubits model. This allows us to construct single-bit OTM’s which only leak an exponentially small amount of information. We then study a natural generalization of the isolated qubits model, where the adversary is allowed to perform a polynomially-bounded number of entangling gates, in addition to unbounded local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We show that our technique for privacy amplification is also secure in this setting. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.","","Hash functions; Amount of information; Cryptographic hardware; Local operations and classical communications; Natural generalization; Privacy amplification; Quantum device; Special class; Tamper resistant; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Lo H.-K., Chau H.F., Is quantum bit commitment really possible?, Phys.
