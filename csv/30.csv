This seemingly undesirable phenomenon is harnessed in quantum cryptography. Uncloneable cryptography studies settings in which the impossibility of copying is a desired property, and achieves forms of security that are classically unattainable. The first example discovered and analyzed was in the context of cash. On the one hand, we want users to hold the cash; on the other hand, the cash should be hard to counterfeit. Quantum money uses variants of the no-cloning theorem to make counterfeiting impossible.In the past decade, this field developed in various directions: several flavors of quantum money, such as classically verifiable, locally verifiable, semi-quantum, quantum coins, and quantum lightning were constructed. New uncloneable primitives were introduced, such as uncloneable signatures, quantum copy protection for classical software, pseudorandom states, and several uncloneable forms of encryption. This work is a gentle introduction to these topics.  © 2023 ACM.","No-cloning; Quantum Cryptography","Clone cells; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Classical information; Copy protection; No-cloning; No-cloning theorem; Property; Pseudo-random; Quantum Information; Cloning","","","","","","","Aaronson S., Quantum copy-protection and quantummoney,  Annual IEEE Conf. on Computational Complexity, CCC 2009, pp. 229-242, (2009); Aaronson S., Christiano P., Quantum money from hidden subspaces, Theory of Computing, 9, pp. 349-401, (2013); Aaronson S., Et al., New Approaches for Quantum Copy-Protection, Volume 12825 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1, pp. 526-555, (2021); Ambainis A., Emerson J., Quantum t-designs:t-wise independence in the quantum world,  Annual IEEE Conf. on Computational Complexity (CCC 2007), pp. 129-140, (2007); Amos R., Et al., One-shot signatures and applications to hybrid quantum/classical authentication,  Annual ACM SIGACT Symp. on Theory of Computing, STOC 2020, pp. 255-268, (2020); Ananth P., Kaleoglu F., Unclonable encryption, revisited, TCC.
