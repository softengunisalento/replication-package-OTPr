We stress that we avoid converting the RAM programs into circuits. As an example, our techniques implies the first garbled binary search program (searching over sorted encrypted data stored in a cloud) which is poly-logarithmic in the data size instead of linear. Our result requires the existence of one-way function and enjoys the same non-interactive properties as Yao’s original garbled circuits.","2013","2024-05-20 10:52:56","2024-05-20 10:52:56","","719-734","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","Berlin, Heidelberg","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>Export Date: 20 May 2024; Cited By: 170</p> </div>","","","","","Johansson, Thomas; Nguyen, Phong Q.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
