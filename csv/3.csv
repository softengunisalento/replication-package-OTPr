In many settings, the circuit can be garbled off-line without strict efficiency constraints, but the input must be garbled very efficiently on-line, with much lower complexity than evaluating the circuit. Yao’s garbling scheme [31] has essentially optimal on-line complexity, but only achieves selective security, where the adversary must choose the input x prior to seeing the garbled circuit. It has remained an open problem to achieve adaptive security, where the adversary can choose x after seeing the garbled circuit, while preserving on-line efficiency. In this work, we modify Yao’s scheme in a way that allows us to prove adaptive security under one-way functions. In our main instantiation we achieve on-line complexity only proportional to the width w of the circuit. Alternatively we can also get an instantiation with on-line complexity only proportional to the depth d (and the output size) of the circuit, albeit incurring in a 2O(d) security loss in our reduction. More broadly, we relate the on-line complexity of adaptively secure garbling schemes in our framework to a certain type of pebble complexity of the circuit. As our main tool, of independent interest, we develop a new notion of somewhere equivocal encryption, which allows us to efficiently equivocate on a small subset of the message bits. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2016.","Adaptive security; Garbled circuits; Online/offline twoparty computation","Efficiency; Timing circuits; Adaptive security; Garbled circuits; Line efficiency; Lower complexity; On-line complexity; One-way functions; Strict efficiency; Two-party computation; Cryptography","","","","","US-Israel BSF, (2008411); National Science Foundation, NSF, (09165174, 1012798, 1065276, 1118126, 1136174, CNS-1314722, CNS-1347350, CNS-1413964, CNS-1414119); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Simons Foundation, SF, (CNS-1523467); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","Funding text 1: A.
