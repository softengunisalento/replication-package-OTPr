In particular, we incorporate the garbling gadgets for arithmetic circuits recently presented by Ball, Malkin, and Rosulek (ACM CCS 2016) into the multiparty garbling paradigm initially introduced by Beaver, Micali, and Rogaway (STOC ’90). This is the first work that studies arithmetic garbled circuits in the multiparty setting. Using mixed Boolean-arithmetic circuits allows more efficient secure computation of functions that naturally combine Boolean and arithmetic computations. Our garbled circuits are secure in the semi-honest model, under the same hardness assumptions as Ball et al., and can be efficiently and securely computed in constant rounds assuming an honest majority. We first extend free addition and multiplication by a constant to the multiparty setting. We then extend to the multiparty setting efficient garbled multiplication gates. The garbled multiplication gate construction we show was previously achieved only in the two-party setting and assuming a random oracle. We further present a new garbling technique, and show how this technique can improve efficiency in garbling selector gates. Selector gates compute a simple “if statement” in the arithmetic setting: the gate selects the output value from two input integer values, according to a Boolean selector bit; if the bit is 0 the output equals the first value, and if the bit is 1 the output equals the second value. Using our new technique, we show a new and designated garbled selector gate that reduces by approximately 33% the evaluation time, for any number of parties, from the best previously known constructions that use existing techniques and are secure based on the same hardness assumptions. On the downside, we find that testing equality and computing exponentiation by a constant are significantly more complex to garble in the multiparty setting than in the two-party setting. © 2018, International Association for Cryptologic Research.","Arithmetic garbled circuits; Constant round MPC; Multiparty garbling","Cryptography; Hardness; Logic circuits; Security of data; Timing circuits; Arithmetic circuit; Arithmetic computations; Constant round MPC; Garbled circuits; Gate construction; Multiparty garbling; Secure computation; Secure multi-party computation; Computation theory","","","","","Frankel Center for Computer Science; Iowa Science Foundation, ISF, (152/17); Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, BGU","Keywords: Arithmetic garbled circuits · Constant round MPC Multiparty garbling Research supported by ISF grant 152/17, by the Frankel Center for Computer Science, and by the BGU Cyber Security Research Center.","Applebaum B., Ishai Y., Kushilevitz E., How to garble arithmetic circuits, Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE 52Nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS 2011, pp. 120-129, (2011); Ball M., Malkin T., Rosulek M., Garbling gadgets for Boolean and arithmetic circuits, Proceedings of the 23Rd Conference on Computer and Communications Security, ACM CCS, pp. 565-577, (2016); Bar-Ilan J., Beaver D., Non-cryptographic fault-tolerant computing in constant number of rounds of interaction, PODC, (1989); Beaver D., Micali S., Rogaway P., The round complexity of secure protocols, Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, STOC, 1990, pp. 503-513, (1990); Bellare M., Hoang V.T., Keelveedhi S., Rogaway P., Efficient garbling from a fixed-key blockcipher, 2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, SP 2013, Berkeley, CA, USA, 19–22 May 2013, pp. 478-492, (2013); Ben-David A., Nisan N., Pinkas B., FairplayMP: A system for secure multi-party computation, Proceedings of the 15Th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, ACM CCS, pp. 257-266, (2008); Ben-Efraim A., Omri E., Concrete efficiency improvements for multiparty garbling with an honest majority, Proceedings of the 5Th International Conference on Progress in Cryptology, LATINCRYPT, (2017); Ben-Efraim A., Lindell Y., Omri E., Optimizing semi-honest secure multiparty computation for the internet, Proceedings of the 23Rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, ACM CCS, pp. 578-590, (2016); Ben-Or M., Goldwasser S., Wigderson A., Completeness theorems for noncrypto-graphic fault-tolerant distributed computations, Proceedings of the 20Th ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, pp. 1-10, (1988); Bogdanov D., Laur S., Willemson J., Sharemind: A framework for fast privacy-preserving computations, ESORICS 2008.
