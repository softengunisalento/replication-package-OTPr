Recent work in CRYPTO’14 presented examples of physical zero-knowledge proofs of physical properties, a special case of secure physical two-party computation in which one party has a physical input and the second party verifies a boolean function of that input. While the work suggested a general framework for modeling and analyzing physical zero-knowledge protocols, it did not provide a general theory of how to prove any physical property with zero-knowledge. This paper takes an orthogonal approach using disposable circuits (DC)—cheap hardware tokens that can be completely destroyed after a computation—an extension of the familiar tamper-proof token model. In the DC model, we demonstrate that two parties can compute any function of their physical inputs in a way that leaks at most 1 bit of additional information to either party. Moreover, our result generalizes to any multi-party physical computation. Formally, our protocols achieve unconditional UC-security with input-dependent abort. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.","","Cryptography; Physical properties; Timing circuits; General theory; Hardware tokens; Presented examples; Tamper-proof tokens; Two-party computation; Zero knowledge; Zero knowledge proof; Zero-knowledge protocols; Boolean functions","","","","","","","Ben-Or M., Goldwasser S., Kilian J., Wigderson A., Multi-prover interactive proofs: How to remove intractability assumptions, 20th ACM STOC, pp. 113-131, (1988); Canetti R., Security and composition of multiparty cryptographic protocols, Journal of Cryptology, 13, 1, pp. 143-202, (2000); Canetti R., Universally composable security: A new paradigm for cryptographic protocols, 42nd FOCS, pp. 136-145, (2001); Fisch B., Freund D., Naor M., Physical zero-knowledge proofs of physical properties, CRYPTO 2014, 8617, pp. 313-336, (2014); Frederiksen T.K., Jakobsen T.P., Nielsen J.B., Nordholt P.S., Orlandi C., MiniLEGO: Efficient secure two-party computation from general assumptions, EUROCRYPT 2013.
